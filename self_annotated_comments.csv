Why use a Private Jet? He could go to Kenya on a Commrcial flight. Multiple people using the flight, thus reducing the amount of carbon used by each of them.

The rule, which was finalized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, repeals a Trump administration decision that stripped safeguards for the forest in southeastern Alaska. The agency‚Äôs plan prohibits road construction, reconstruction and timber harvest in the rainforest‚Äôs roadless areas.
  

  
The Tongass is a pristine area of 16.7 million acres that serves as a major carbon sink and provides habitat for wildlife such as salmon and trout, brown bears and bald eagles. The rainforest is also considered critical for carbon sequestration and storage to help mitigate climate change. The country‚Äôs forests absorb carbon dioxide equivalent to more than 10% of U.S. annual greenhouse gas emissions, according to the USDA.
  

  
‚ÄúAs our nation‚Äôs largest national forest and the largest intact temperate rainforest in the world, the Tongass National Forest is key to conserving biodiversity and addressing the climate crisis,‚Äù Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.

Isn't he the one that decimated Indias farming community ?

Not all devils are red.

If you don't know what im talking about the quick simple version is .

Bill Gates wants to own as much farm land as possible (he already owns about as much as he can in the U.S.) 

India doesn't allow foreign entities to own land so Billy boy bought a bunch of banks then convinced the majority of farmers that with proper techniques and technology they could up their production . Really bring their little farm into the future . His company then taught them this new way and lent them money to buy the equipment.  Of course it's not really that  better and doesn't produce enough for them to afford to pay back the huge loans and when they fail on their payments.  Badda boom badda Bing the bank now owns their farm and Billy boy owns the banks. Look at that. Of course their were mass protests and a ton of deaths including a lot of suicides as people had lost everything their families had worked for for generations.

And why should we hold these people less responsible than mass murderers which have killed millions of people, like from the Nazi government in Germany after WWII ? 

I think there will be a kind of trial in La Hague, within my life time.

These oil bosses had plenty of time to think what the consequences of their actions are. They had the best scientists, and paid them to silence them.

The world is inching toward an event where the population of a large city dies within a few days, due to heat that is not survivable. It could be Delhi, it could be Rio, maybe a city in Southern China.

And when that happens, this will be a shame to all of humanity, like an atomic bomb dropped on helpless people. How are we going to look into a mirror and like what we see?

Do you remember the [Golden Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record) which was sent with the Voyager space probe, just in case another civilization out there would find our little human artefact? A record with music and pictures of children laughing. In a way, it is humanity's business card, including some instructions on where to find our lovely blue planet.

I imagine how it would be if some friendly aliens land after the event, and would demand to speak with our ""leaders"".  ""Mr. President, we need to talk with you.""

How would they look them into their eyes?

No facts. 

Having been on the energy front lines for many years.  So called ‚Äúenvironmentalists‚Äù are a big part of the reason we are in this situation. 

I graduated with a nuclear engineering degree ready to fix the world, started work, and two weeks later Three Mile Island happened. End result: expensive but basically no harm to people. I was on the industry ‚Äúlessons learned group‚Äù. Suddenly everything nuclear was halted. 

Protestors marched around my office saying they were going to kill the engineers when they came out. I slept under my desk. The head protester said LIVE ON TELEVISION he was going to assassinate our CEO when he went to the parking garage to get in his car. We gave up, our plant was cancelled after spending $600 million dollars. 

That summer we had a heat wave. Heat waves are not a  new phenomena. We were around 117¬∞F / 47.2¬∞C for maybe 10 days. 

We had an electrical grid display in our Electrical Engineering department. We were within minutes of losing the entire grid (SPP). We were doing things like starting 5MW diesel generators designed only for emergency backup of the plants and wiring these meager amounts into the grid. We got within 2MW of the grid failing over an area of 161,000 square miles and a black-start, our worse nightmare. Our electric frequency was 15 seconds behind with the rolling blackouts. 

When we turned on the local news the ‚Äúenvironmentalists‚Äù said it was all a big hoax, we were lying, and we had at least 40% extra capacity, but we were playing politics to pretend there was an artificial shortage to win a rate case! We didn‚Äôt need anymore capacity!

Then Jimmy Carter cancelled the Clinch River Breeder reactor, the technology of which could provide fuel for 1000 years with existing technology (not fusion). Breeder reactor cannot now be licensed. The Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) was cancelled. This is the reason all of you are much less safe and the highly radioactive spent fuel rods are STILL stored at each plant. 

Then, Jimmy Carter mandated that in seven years we could no longer use natural gas as boiler fuel. As a result, we built 17 western coal and mine-mouth lignite plants to replace them. How was that for the CO2 emissions?

Don‚Äôt blame me. We could have been like France, getting 95% of our electricity from nuclear, happy, and continuing the move toward renewables, electric cars and synfuels for aircraft. 

Maybe Bill Gate‚Äôs traveling wave reactor in Wyoming will save us someday. 

As it is, we have steadily reduced our CO2 emissions in the US from 6,003 Million Metric Tons in 2007, to 4,571 Million Metric Tons in 2020. 

My math says this is 23.9% in 13 years, and the reduction is accelerating. Same period for Germany was 9.5%",11/2/21 8:07,6,/r/climate/comments/qkheh0/the_scientists_are_terrified_a_survey_of_the/hizkswg/,0

 The global modern society since the Industrial Revolution is dependent upon vast amounts of affordable energy. 
 OIL is all around you every day. 
 It‚Äôs in your clothes, your shoes. Your electronics. Your medicines. Your shampoo. Your coffee. Your food is grown with it. Your home is kept at a livable temperature because of it.  Everything you encounter daily is either made form OIL and/or vast amounts of OIL was used to allow you the convenience and access to it. 

 Your all natural laundry detergent in the 100% recycled bottle was recycled using vast amounts of energy and was  transported half way across the country or the world to you with vast amounts of OIL. 

 Climate change is real and it‚Äôs happening. 

 Palm oil is also destroying life on earth as is mining for precious metals, cattle, lumber and 1,000 other industries. 

 To realize the enormous scale of impact our modem way of life is having on the planet - that every single one of us contributes to every minute of everyday - is to also realize the utter futility of trying to change it in any meaningful way within our lifetime.",2/1/23 7:19,14,/r/climate/comments/10qhis2/exxon_vaults_to_record_annual_profit_of_557/j6r00wy/,1

Biden specifically said he would only ban **new** fracking and only on public land. He did so for political reasons since Pennsylvania has a lot of fracking industry and it is a critical swing state. This calculation will not change in the near future and that makes it very dangerous for Democrats and Republicans alike to ban fracking.

The senate will likely remain in Republican hands, and filibusters are always an option to block legislation even if they do not. So any form of carbon pricing will almost certainly face massive resistance and likely die in the senat.

>
>Propane is made of fossil fuels and emits CO2 when burned. Much of PERC‚Äôs messaging around propane is that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù fuel; while propane may emit less CO2 than using coal, oil, or other fossil fuels, it still has a carbon footprint. The comparison of propane to dirtier fuels here‚Äîand giving it the moniker ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù or ‚Äúlower carbon‚Äù when compared to these fuels‚Äîis a deliberate industry misdirect from the zero emissions future that scientists have stressed we need to achieve.
>
>Searching for Blashaw‚Äôs name with ‚Äúpropane‚Äù turns up a lot of interesting results. Blashaw, a hunky contractor who has hosted a number of HGTV shows, routinely does feel-good local news spots extolling the virtues of propane. In a particular twist of irony, he hosted one such segment last year for Earth Day talking about how propane is a good choice for the planet-conscious.
>
>‚Äú[On] Earth Day, we‚Äôre thinking about being stewards for the planet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time right now to use a very diverse, low-carbon energy mix to power homes and businesses. ‚Ä¶We talk about electrifying everything, but that‚Äôs really not the answer at this point.‚Äù Propane, Blashaw went on, is a ‚Äúclean burner, it cleans up the environment.‚Äù
>
>Calandrelli, meanwhile, describes herself as a ‚ÄúMIT engineer + Emmy-nominated TV host‚Äù on her Instagram page. She has appeared on a number of local television programs as part of a campaign with PERC to promote propane buses, touting them as cleaner than diesel and less expensive than electric buses.

This is where regulation really needs to play a key role. Expecting an industry to sunset themselves is almost invariably doomed to fail, especially in an industry that is so large and influential as the ones dealing in resource extraction and refining. There need to be clear steps to move away from resource extraction and consumption as a default, and we need to ensure that regulators hear and understand this message.",1/17/23 16:32,47,/r/climate/comments/10egfje/the_propane_industry_is_paying_tv_influencers_to/j4qp1vx/,0

1. [**Vote**](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge), in *[every](https://www.vote.org/election-reminders/)* election. People who prioritize climate change and the environment [have historically not been very reliable voters, which explains much of the lackadaisical response of lawmakers](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/news/millions-environmentalists-are-registered-vote-us-dont-what-if-they-did), and many Americans don't realize we should be voting (on average) [in 3-4 elections per year](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/news/millions-environmentalists-are-registered-vote-us-dont-what-if-they-did). In 2018 in the U.S., the percentage of voters prioritizing the environment [more than tripled](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/green/A-Green-Wave-Signs-Point-to-Voters-Demanding-Action-on-Climate-Change-502796391.html), and then [climate change became a priority issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal) for lawmakers. [According to researchers](https://web.archive.org/web/20210813112459/https://academictimes.com/single-issue-voters-may-drive-senators-away-from-majority-opinion/), voters focused on environmental policy are particularly influential because they represent a group that senators can win over, often without alienating an equally well-organized, hyper-focused opposition. Even if you don't like any of the candidates or live in a 'safe' district, [**whether or not you vote is a matter of public record**](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/april-may-june-2018/planet-earth-gets-a-ground-game/), and **[it's fairly easy to figure out if you care about the environment or climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U&t=2m53s)**. Politicians [use this information](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x) to prioritize agendas. Voting in every election, even the minor ones, [will raise the profile and power of your values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U&t=2m53s). If you don't [vote](https://voteclimatepac.org/voters-guide/), you and your values can safely be ignored.

2. [**Lobby**](https://cclusa.org/x), at *every* [lever of political will](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/levers-of-political-will/). Lobbying [works](http://web.stanford.edu/~jdmunoz/Olzak,%20Soule,%20Coddou,%20and%20Mu%F1oz%202016.pdf), and you [don't need a lot of money to be effective](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1016.1967&rep=rep1&type=pdf) (though it does help to [educate yourself on effective tactics](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf)). According to NASA climatologist [James Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hansen), becoming an active volunteer with [this group](https://cclusa.org/x) is the [most important thing an individual can do on climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAW1A6Ca8).

Numbers [matter](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitizensClimateLobby/comments/ticd9x/the_eicda_carbon_tax_dividend_bill_got_its_96th/) so your support can really make a difference.

3. [**Recruit**](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/), *across the political spectrum*. Most of us are [either alarmed or concerned](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-september-2021/) about climate change, yet most aren't taking [the necessary steps](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) to solve the problem -- the [most common reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6DoiQM_-is&t=1342s) is that no one asked. If all of us who are ['very worried'](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/03/21/worries-priorities-and-potential-problem-solvers/) about climate change [organized](https://cclusa.org/x) we would be >26x more powerful than the NRA.

>Bloomfield argues that disinformation sticks for a reason, and that simply telling the people who fall for it that there‚Äôs a scientific consensus isn‚Äôt enough.
>
>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre doubting climate change because they doubt scientific authorities,‚Äù Bloomfield said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre making decisions about the environment, not based on the facts or the science, but based on their values or other things that are important to them.‚Äù
>
>While political identity can explain some resistance to climate change, there are other reasons people dismiss the evidence, as Bloomfield outlines in her upcoming book Science v. Story: Narrative Strategies for Science Communicators.
>
>‚ÄúIn the climate change story, we‚Äôre the villains, or at least partially blameworthy for what‚Äôs happening to the environment, and it requires us to make a lot of sacrifices,‚Äù Bloomfield said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a hard story to adopt because of the role we‚Äôre playing within it.‚Äù Accepting climate change, to some degree, means accepting inner conflict. You always know you could do more to lower your carbon footprint, whether that‚Äôs ditching meat, refusing to fly, or wearing your old clothes until they‚Äôre threadbare and ratty.
>
>By contrast, embracing climate denial allows people to identify as heroes, Bloomfield said. They don‚Äôt have to do anything differently, and might even see driving around in a gas-guzzling truck as part of God‚Äôs plan. It‚Äôs a comforting narrative, and certainly easier than wrestling with ethical dilemmas or existential dread.
>
>...
>
>The most straightforward way to fight disinformation would be to stop it from happening in the first place, Spampatti said. But even if regulators were able to get social media companies to try to stop the spread of conspiracy theories and falsehoods, dislodging them is a different story. One promising approach, ‚Äúdeep canvassing,‚Äù seeks to persuade people through nonjudgmental, one-on-one conversations. The outreach method, invented by LGBTQ+ advocates, involves hearing people‚Äôs concerns and helping them work through their conflicted feelings. (Remember how accepting climate change means accepting you might be a tiny part of the problem?)
>
>Research has shown that deep canvassing isn‚Äôt just successful at reducing transphobia, but also that its effects can last for months, a long time compared to other interventions. The strategy can work for other polarizing problems, too, based on one experiment in a rural metal-smelting town in British Columbia. After convincing several local governments across the West Kootenay region to shift to 100 per cent renewable energy, volunteers with the non-profit Neighbours United kept running into difficulties in the city of Trail, where they encountered distrust of environmentalists. They spoke to hundreds of residents, listening to their worries about losing jobs, finding common ground, and telling personal stories about climate change like friends would, instead of debating the facts like antagonists. A stunning 40 per cent of residents shifted their beliefs, and Trail‚Äôs city council voted in 2022 to shift to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2050.
>
>Both facts and stories have a place, Bloomfield said. For conservative audiences, she suggests that climate advocates move away from talking about global systems and scientists with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ‚Äî a ‚Äúnameless, faceless, nebulous group of people‚Äù ‚Äî and toward local matters and people they actually know. Getting information from friends, family, and other trusted individuals can really help.
>
>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not necessarily as authoritative as the IPCC,‚Äù Bloomfield said. ‚ÄúBut it helps you connect with that information, and you trust that person, so you trust that information that they‚Äôre resharing.‚Äù

This idea of one-on-one conversations isn't a new one, but it looks like it's still remarkably effective. For some people that personal connection, whether actual or perceived, carries more weight than academic research and it would be helpful for us to engage on that personal level. It might be more work in some regards, but also looks to yield tangible benefits.",12/22/23 15:28,55,/r/climate/comments/18oh9tk/why_people_still_fall_for_fake_climate_news_it/keh2gqk/,0

>The world's top management consultancy McKinsey & Company is using its position as a key adviser to the U.N.'s COP28 climate talks to push the interests of its big oil and gas clients, undermining efforts to end the use of the fossil fuels driving global warming, according to multiple sources and leaked documents.
>
>Behind closed doors, the U.S.-based firm has proposed future energy scenarios to the agenda setters of the summit that are at odds with the climate goals it publicly espouses, an AFP investigation has found.
>
>An ""energy transition narrative"" drafted by the firm and obtained by AFP only reduces oil use by 50 percent by 2050, and allows for trillions of dollars of continued investments in ""high-emissions assets"" per year up to mid-century.
>
>McKinsey -- whose big oil clients range from America's ExxonMobil to Saudi Arabia's state-run Aramco -- is one of several consultancies giving free advice to the United Arab Emirates as it hosts the critical negotiations, which start on November 30.
>
>Controversially, the talks are being presided over by Sultan Al Jaber, head of the Emirati state oil firm ADNOC.
>
>With scientists saying 2023 is certain to be the hottest year on record, and greenhouse gas emissions headed for unprecedented levels, McKinsey is ""vocally and brazenly calling for lower levels of ambition on oil phase-out at the highest levels within the COP28 presidency,"" said a source who was in the room on confidential discussions with the summit hosts.
>
>...
>
>Some of McKinsey's rival consultancies operating in Dubai have worked in the spirit of finding genuine climate solutions, according to three sources who have taken part in high-level preparatory meetings, who asked not to be named as the proceedings were confidential.
>
>""But it was very clear from an early stage that McKinsey had a conflict of interest,"" said a source who took part in COP28 presidency discussions. ""They would give advice at the highest levels that was not in the best interest of the COP president as the leader of a multilateral climate agreement, but in the best interest of the COP president as the CEO of one of the region's biggest oil and gas companies.""
>
>Confidential documents seen by AFP back this up.
>
>The McKinsey energy scenario for the COP28 presidency ""reads as if it was written by the oil industry for the oil industry"", said Kingsmill Bond, a top equity expert who analyzed it.
>
>...
>
>""On average, 40-50 MMb/d (millions of barrels per day) of oil is still expected to be utilized in 2050,"" compared to about 100 MMb/d today, McKinsey's narrative said.
>
>That is twice the amount allowed in the International Energy Agency (IEA) net zero roadmap, said Jim Williams of the University of San Francisco, a top modeler of decarbonization trajectories.
>
>The IEA says CO2-removal technologies must scale up 100,000-fold by 2050 to stay on track for a net zero world -- a mind-boggling challenge with no guarantee of success.
>
>But the McKinsey scenario would likely require at least double that, experts said.
>
>""It must involve either far more massive levels of negative emissions technologies"" that pull CO2 out of the air, ""or an even faster phase out of coal and gas"", said former BP geologist Mike Coffin, head of the Oil, Gas and Mining team at Carbon Tracker.
>
>McKinsey's draft for COP28 says that up to mid-century, $2.7 trillion a year in continued investment will have to be sunk into ""high-emissions assets"", including ones related to oil and gas as well as various other areas such as heavy industry and agriculture.
>
>""Even with the current situation and no additional climate policies, we expect that global oil demand will peak in this decade,"" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.
>
>But many oil and gas majors -- buoyed by high prices and profits in the wake of the war in Ukraine -- have backed off commitments to transition to renewables or, in some cases, doubled down on their core business.

People need to understand that this article's characterization of the bill is **compete hogwash**. It's dishonest. 

The truth is that the **40% reduction is comparing the 2030 projection to 2005 emission levels** in the United States.

Emissions have **already been declining** in the US from 6.75 gigatons in 2005 to 6.00 gigatons in 2019 as a result of transition to renewables. That over 10% reduction already in the bank.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/ghg-greenhouse-gas-emissions](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/ghg-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

The continued secular trend of transition to renewables due to their economic advantage without this bill had the US on track to a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 **without this bill.** 

**The incremental reduction associated with this bill is roughly 7-9%**. That's a good thing and a step in the right direction. But we need to look at things objectively and realize that **this is not a measure which is commensurate with the objectives the IPCC** has identified as necessary to avert climate catastrophe.",12/30/22 22:42,14,/r/climate/comments/zz0rzs/the_us_passed_a_historic_climate_deal_this_year/j2aznu3/,0

That was made apparent by the most comprehensive study on the topic by Oxford research scientists. Here is a quote about the study by the lead author-  
‚ÄúChanging your diet to avoid animal products reduces your emissions for a typical global consumer by 28 percent, land use by 75% and water pollution by around 60%,‚Äù says Poore. ‚ÄúDiet change is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on the environment.‚Äù  
Joseph Poore switched to a plant based diet after seeing the results of the study.

1. Get meat back fully back onto pasture even if that makes it a more scarce food. Who needs a 12 oz steak or double quarter pounder every day.

They're using a single pulse from lasers to explode a tiny fuel pellet.  This needs to go from happening once every month or so to happening hundreds of times an hour.  They system may get more energy out in heat than the lasers put in...but the lasers are inefficient, so you can't get as much energy out of the machine as you put in.

In short, this has a huge amount of engineering work to be done before its' practical, if ever.  If things go really well, that might mean:

* 2030 - a pilot plant starts working
* 2040 - first commercial operation
* 2060 - widespread commercial use

Meanwhile, we need net zero by 2050, with large emissions cuts before then.

At that point they should have a nice fat stack of cash to be able to adjust to whatever business opportunities present themselves.

Global warming is actually a business opportunity and it's going to be extremely profitable for those with the resources and positioning to take advantage of it.

Yes yes some people will die probably a lot of them but no one important none of the people with money will die and in fact that human death will just present more business opportunities it's a win-win for them.

And it is... stunning.

All of this has been laid bare by the removal of sulfates from shipping fuel‚Äîthat were masking the climate sensitivity over particular regions up until recent years. Which has, in essence, created an unintended experiment. 

From the paper (linked above):

> Changes of IMO [International Maritime Organization] emission regulations provide a great opportunity for insight into aerosol climate forcing. Sulfur content of fuels was limited to 1% in 2010 near the coasts of North America and in the North Sea, Baltic Sea and English Channel, and further restricted there to 0.1% in 2015. In 2020 a limit of 0.5% was imposed worldwide. The 1% limit did not have a noticeable effect on ship-tracks, but a striking reduction of ship-tracks was found after the 2015 IMO regulations, especially in the regions near land where emissions were specifically limited. Following the additional 2020 regulations, global ship-tracks were reduced more than 50%.

IMO, that graph may very well go down as a landmark in the wider world every bit as much as the Keeling curve and the hockey stick. Especially if more work is done in the years ahead that can further corroborate these findings. And if they are, that graph, in no small measure, reveals just how much of a lie we have been living in, for decades. All of the shenanigans from deniers. All of the delaying. For so many decades. All of it may have been aided and abetted by a kind of large-scale atmospheric fiction.",11/4/23 0:21,99,/r/climate/comments/17n57kb/earth_reacts_to_greenhouse_gases_more_strongly/k7q611e/,0

Yes, that is largely [because](https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-steven-koonin-publishes-misleading-claims-climate-change-influences-greenland-ice-melt/) there's less slash-and-burn now, as opposed to wildfires being less intense, but the point still stands.

In hindsight, I would have bought a less efficient unit with less doodads to go wrong and which cost less to fix when they did.

The repair guy told me that I'd have been better off to buy a lower end, less efficient unit 10 years ago when I had my high efficiency dreams.  Once the pricey repair component costs are factored in, I'd have been money ahead despite the slightly higher utility costs per month.

Note to self: next time, buy the middle of the line, average Joe unit with less high efficiency gizmos, and worry less about the high SEER rating and saving the planet singlehandedly.",11/5/22 6:21,13,/r/climate/comments/ymkxua/new_dwellings_in_washington_state_must_be_warmed/iv4jfgp/,0

It's still not as low as it got to in 2012 though it is very near that level. In 2012 they spent a million or so dredging out a few inches near Thebes IL in order to keep traffic going even if it was one at a time.

Again they are at one at a time traffic. Some barges are just sitting and not moving (that was a company choice). The other day I was walking the river and watched as two barges sat all day as two others went down river. Of the two just sitting one was facing down river the other up river.

They are carrying way less than normal. Normally the containers are overflowing with what ever they are moving. Now at times you can barely see anything in the containers.

If this time holds with the 2012/2013 flow the river will rise to flood stages by Feb. or March. The river will start to rise in late Dec or early Jan. (again that's if it holds like the past). Living on the river nearly every Spring there are degrees of flooding and later in the year a lower river.

My area just got the first rain in like a month and a half and it wasn't much of anything. I'm not at all dismissing CC it's happening. I see it in the river and everything else. The droughts used to not come as often (or to this severity). One way to judge river stages of ""oh crap"" is being able to walk out to Tower Rock in Altenburg. In 2012 you could get there with out getting wet. As of now you still have an almost knee depth to wade in a short spot, but it is accessible. The local news has been talking about it and a normally empty nature area is suddenly flooded with idiots out trashing things. I suspect that by next month (that's quite liberal as it will likely be sooner) you will once again be able to get to Tower Rock without getting wet.

River stages seem to have been dropping about a foot or so a week. I see a lot of dead fish on the shores. Some are fisherman fatalities because people are stupid (they kill gar for no reason). I have counted 3 small sturgeon (possibly due to fisherman) and a lot of the Asian Jumping Carp (not a big loss as they are invasive). Wildlife is having to travel further to get to the water and some areas are becoming more dangerous for that wildlife. Farther from the tree line means they are out in the open for more predators to see and some spots in the banks suddenly drop down or are not stable as water flows under some of the sand bars.

The future is completely screwed I starting to wonder if I will see a time when the river is basically dried up where even normal boats can't travel the river.

Using exceptionally complex and expensive computing systems, scientists found a new way to detect an early warning signal for the collapse of these currents, according to the study published Friday in the journal Science Advances. And as the planet warms, there are already indications it is heading in this direction.

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (the AMOC) ‚Äî of which the Gulf Stream is part ‚Äî works like a giant global conveyor belt, taking warm water from the tropics toward the far North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southward.

The currents carry heat and nutrients to different areas of the globe and play a vital role in keeping the climate of large parts of the Northern Hemisphere relatively mild.

For decades, scientists have been sounding the alarm on the circulation‚Äôs stability as climate change warms the ocean and melts ice, disrupting the balance of heat and salt that determines the currents‚Äô strength.

The topography (big mountains for water to roll down) and its local climate mean that WV has some of the highest flood risks from climate change of any state in the US.

https://www.eenews.net/articles/top-of-the-list-w-va-faces-surprising-climate-dangers/

>A recent state-by-state analysis of flood risk found that West Virginia has the highest percentage of roads, commercial properties and infrastructure in danger of being flooded ‚Äî ahead of every state in the continental U.S., including Florida and Louisiana.

Also in reply to the comments joking about letting WV get flooded ‚Äî I don't think that's a cool thing to say. Yes it's true that WV's population has one of the highest shares of climate deniers and skeptics in the US, but that's only because of coal dependency and general economic disinvestment.

And Joe Manchin is a complete pos who is destroying our collective future but I highly doubt that's because of his constituents and suspect it has much more to do with his coal company and fossil fuel donors. His state could benefit immensely from green economy and climate resilience investments and if he really wanted to benefit his constituents he'd be fighting hard for those things to go to his state, not torpedoing them.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_climate_change_initiatives

It is high time there was a standard framework or action plan which can be readily adopted by any region. The only variation would be the target CO2 reduction and time-lines. Over the top of my head, I can think of a rough action plan:

1. Planting saplings in strategic locations:
https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/how-many-trees-to-plant-to-stop-climate-crisis/

2. Taking into account urban development, industrialization and population growth which could neutralize the tree planting strategy, we need to concurrently transition to renewable energy sources like adoption of EVs for transportation and Solar/Wind/Hydro for power generation.

3. A carbon tax strategy without the trading of carbon credits, and at the same time give incentives or subsidies to companies switching to renewable energy. Low interest business loans for the renewable energy sector.

4. As there would be a huge impact to the fossil fuel sector which will lead to job losses, there needs to be a plan to assist the workers transition to a different industry. IMO this is the most challenging part and not sure how the Govt. can help. Wonder how countries like Germany shutdown coal plants overnight, and what measures were taken to prevent job loss.",10/13/19 22:51,33,/r/climate/comments/dhfogx/scientists_endorse_mass_civil_disobedience_to/f3o2wrs/,0

Oh wait..

No,

I can fathom it.

That the earth is warming?  None.  We know that. Breaking records should be expected.  
So what? 
The real question is, does it matter? 
Where is the evidence that if it raises more than 3degrees C we are doomed?  
Let‚Äôs say that the progress of the industrial revolution has caused all of the increased rate of warming.  What does that mean?  It means that we got to the current average global temp in a hundred years instead of 200 years.  So? 
You‚Äôre telling me that if we never had the industrial revolution we were going to hit this same point, but just in another 100 years instead of now.  So you‚Äôre telling me we were doomed from the beginning?  But we just brought it about faster?  Sorry, I don‚Äôt buy it. 

The simple fact is, we were already warming, and whether we make changes or not we will continue to warm.  What are we going to do when the earth eventually starts it‚Äôs next cooling period that leads to the next ice age?  
Are we then going to force every country back towards fossil fuels to slow down the cooling??

Many scientists appear to have a strong opinion on this. It's that the media doesn't want to be accused of being alarmist because it thinks that sounding alarmist is worse than extinction. Because if this is, as many respectable scientists have been saying for a while now, a _clear_ sign of a problem, then this is an all-hands-on-deck issue. 

Media owners are in such denial that they're asking journalists to, as a matter of policy, promote that denial by not switching all available coverage to this very serious problem. They see it as their duty to maintain order, as if order can be maintained by sheer force of media will and does not require physics to align.  They don't want to lose the viewers, but... newsflash... losing a habitable ecosphere _will_ lose viewers, and soon if they keep being in denial.

I suppose we'll want to wait to after the election to mention this an issue in order to maximize the chances that we elect a party that would rather corruptly make short term bucks on business as usual than fix the problem.  Soon even short term nonsense like that will be unsupportable if the acceleration is anything like many of the signs are pointing to.

At the end of the day space exploration will achieve the goal of helping with climate change. Without radically changing our economy, way of living, and curing our insatiable addiction to stuff, ""focusing"" on the environment isn't going to win the day. Like it or not, most people are motivated by incentives, not an urge to make the world a better place. Even a lot of folks who wish for a better tomorrow don't bother to recycle or even cancel their Amazon Prime account in favor of supporting a small, more sustainable business.

We collectively need off of this rock to move forward as a species. We have something akin to global cabin fever, continuously poking at one another over petty differences and wasting energy going to war over diminishing resources. Exploring the last great unknown is the only way to fix it. We're explorers by nature, a curious bunch. As far as we can tell, space is functionally infinite. That means infinite possibilities, infinite resources, and infinite opportunity.

That's why billionaires are spending their money reaching for space. They're ready to move industry to the stars and beyond. Governments won't do it and why would they? Their business model operates on fear and control. An exploratory, interplanetary populous filled with real purpose would be a pretty hard bunch to control and keep in line.

climate,Youth activists win unprecedented victory in suit suing Montana for ignoring climate change,15r1m5w,theindependentonline,,https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/montana-judge-climate-change-lawsuit-b2392891.html,,8/14/23 17:47,645,/r/climate/comments/15r1m5w/youth_activists_win_unprecedented_victory_in_suit/,jw6dyxt,Sky_minder,"This is exceptionally good news, for many reasons.

A provision in the state constitution specifically calls out the need to protect the environment for the health of its residents. It was written back when conservatives were actually intent on conserving something.

The legal implications are wide-reaching, but the immediate strategy is to get such amendments to state Constitutions wherever possible, now know that there is legal precedent to defend them.

There is another victory here. Center-left political strategists have been pretty cowardly on environmental issues despite support for climate and environmental action repeatedly polling at the top of concerns in many states, including Michigan. The argument against aggressive environmental protection is that it will never work, that strategies like this are doomed to fail and backfire, that the opposition is too strong and too well-funded.

Those viewpoints surrendered without a fight to the anti-environmental policies of labor unions and corporate conservatives. No one had ever actually had the courage to do what these young people did. They've not only won a victory for the climate, but they've taught middling liberals that having a spine will win.

Something else key: ""The state began and rested its defense on the same day, bringing the trial to an unexpectedly early close on June 20. In a pivot from its expected defense disputing the climate science behind the plaintiffs‚Äô case, the state focused instead on arguing that the legislature should weigh in on the contested law, not the judiciary.""

That's telling. Anti-environmental conservatives now realize that they will lose if they enter into a debate on the facts and science of climate change. The evidence is overwhelming, the conclusions unequivocal. They know that repeating fossil fuel misinformation in court will backfire, so they've turned to other tactics and arguments.",8/14/23 18:51,99,/r/climate/comments/15r1m5w/youth_activists_win_unprecedented_victory_in_suit/jw6dyxt/,0

The richest 10 percent of U.S. households are responsible for 40 percent of the country‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions, according to a study released Thursday in PLOS Climate. The study, which looked at how a household‚Äôs income generated emissions, underlines the stark divide between those who benefit most from fossil fuels and those who are most burdened by its effects.  
  
People often think of their carbon footprint in terms of consumption, such as how they get to work or what they eat, but those provide an incomplete view of who is responsible for a lot of greenhouse gas activity, said Jared Starr, lead author of the study.  
  
Many of the ways people earn money are also linked to carbon pollution, including from how and where they earn their wages to where they invest parts of their income. These investments, especially if linked with fossil fuel-related industries, can seriously tip who is most responsible for the nation‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions, said Starr.  
  
‚ÄúIt just seems morally and politically problematic to have one group of people reaping so much benefit from emissions while the poorer groups in society are asked to disproportionately deal with the harms of those emissions,‚Äù Starr, a sustainability scientist at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said. Previous research has shown that extreme weather events made worse because of climate change, from flooding to hurricanes, often has a greater effect on lower-income communities.  
  
Starr and his colleagues analyzed income data across U.S. households from 1990 to 2019 and linked it to emissions generated directly and indirectly from that income. They included income tied to emissions related to the operation of a business, such as from a coal-fired powerplant. But they also included income, such as from investments, that supported services or products from those industries.  
  
‚ÄúAs you move up the income ladder, an increasing share of emissions is associated with investments,‚Äù said Starr.  
  
They found those who make enough income to be in the top 10 percent of American households are responsible for 40 percent of the nation‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions. The top 1 percent of households accounted for 15 to 17 percent of the nation‚Äôs emissions, with investment holdings making up 38 to 42 percent of their emissions.  
  
Then there were ‚Äúsuper-emitters‚Äù with extremely high overall greenhouse gas emissions, corresponding to about the top 0.1 percent of households. About 15 days of emissions from a super-emitter was equal to a lifetime of emissions for someone in the poorest 10 percent in America.  
  
The team found that the highest emissions linked to income came from white, non-Hispanic homes, and the lowest came from Black households. Emissions peaked until age 45 to 54 and then declined.

Leave the fossil sun energy in the ground, convert to use fresh sun energy, and the natural systems will hopefully start to catch up absorbing the carbon from the air we've put there that's holding all the energy released in these events. 

We need to prioritize science working on ways to use sunlight to absorb carbon from the air too, to make various molecules that could be used as ""recycled"" carbon molecules,  and I hope that works out to speed up scrubbing the air.",8/5/22 4:00,2,/r/climate/comments/wfxqvs/massive_floods_in_the_interiors_of_oman_uae_and/ij0f785/,0

Here are some things I'm personally doing:

* I've talked with friends and family about a [carbon tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price). I've convinced several that a carbon tax is a good idea. I've convinced a few to start volunteering for carbon taxes. [34% of Americans would be willing to volunteer for an organization to convince elected officials to act on climate change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). If you feel like you're up against a wall in your own political conversations, [here's some short trainings on how to have better political conversations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/how-to-have-better-political-conversations/). The IPCC has been clear that [carbon pricing is **necessary**](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf), and [talking about climate change has been scientifically shown to be effective at increasing policy support](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/30/14804). 

* It took a few tries, but I published [a Letter to the Editor](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/111) to the largest local paper in my area espousing the need for and benefits of a carbon tax. Maybe you don't read LTEs, but [Congress does](https://www.aclu.org/other/letters-editor-how-write-them-and-why-they-work). 

* I've joined several [organized call-in days](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/text/) asking Congress to take climate change seriously and pass Carbon Fee & Dividend before joining the [monthly call campaign](https://community.citizensclimate.org/tools/monthly-calling-campaign). These [phone calls work](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf), but it will take [at least 100 of us per district](https://republicen.quorum.us/campaign/11713/) to pass a U.S. bill. 

* I wrote to [my favorite podcast](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) about carbon taxes asking them to talk about [the scientific](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economic](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) consensus on their show. When nothing happened, I asked some fellow listeners to write, too. Eventually [they released this episode](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/573) (and [this blog post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/economics-renewables-and-climate-change/)) lauding the benefits of carbon taxes.  

* I've written literally dozens of [letters to my Rep and Senators](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/write-your-representative/) over the last few years asking them to support Carbon Fee & Dividend. I've seen their responses change over the years, too, so I suspect it's working (in fairness, [I'm not the only one](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/accomplishments/), of course). [Over 90% of members of Congress are swayed by contact from constituents](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/citizen-centric-advocacy-2017). 

* I've hosted or co-hosted 4 letter-writing parties so that I could invite people I know to take [meaningful and effective action](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) on climate change.

* At my request, 5 businesses and 2 non-profits have signed [Influencer's Letters to Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/leaders/) calling for Carbon Fee & Dividend. 

* I recruited a friend to help me write a municipal Resolution for our municipality to publicly support Carbon Fee & Dividend. It took a lot of hard work recruiting volunteers from all over the city, sometimes meeting 2-3 times with the same Council member, but eventually it passed unanimously. [Over 100 municipalities have passed similar Resolutions in support of Carbon Fee & Dividend that call on Congress to pass the legislation](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/endorsements/municipal/). 

* I've [tabled](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/290) at several events, usually collecting letters from constituents to their members of Congress

* I started a Meetup in my area to help recruit and train more volunteers who are interested in making this dream a reality. The group now has hundreds of members. I've invited on several new co-leaders who are doing pretty much all the work at this point. 

* It may sound silly, but I invited *almost* all my Facebook friends to ""like"" (and by default, *follow*) CCL on Facebook. Research shows [55% of those who engage with a cause on social media also take additional action](https://www.nptechforgood.com/2013/04/22/12-must-know-stats-about-social-media-fundraising-and-cause-awareness/), and if even 1% of all the friends of everyone who joined just this year became active with CCL, we would have enough volunteers to pass a bill. 

* I gave two [presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/159) to groups of ~20 or so on Carbon Fee & Dividend and why it's a good idea that we should all be advocating for. I [arranged these presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/160) myself. 

* I co-hosted two screenings of [Season 2, Episode 7 of Years of Living Dangerously ""Safe Passage""](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/take-action/host-a-screening/#1485986882331-9e38cb79-9c5e1492-21fb7dd6-03b9bd85-3e3cce1f-2786706c-ee83)

* I attended two meetings in my Representatives' home office to discuss Carbon Fee & Dividend and try to get their support. 

* I've recruited hundreds of Redditors to [join me](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=CarbonTax)

The points made are important -- then *and now*. Because less then half a decade ago, they said we would face drastic climate repercussions in 25 years. Now, the timeline is about a decade. How did we lose 15 years in the span of 5?

Because there are a handful of unknowns. We know our way of life is unsustainable and has terrible effects on the planet. And we take comfort in knowing ""there's still time"". But is there? The estimates are based on what we know -- but they cannot take into account what we don't know.

Whatever the estimates given by science, we need to assume there are unknowns that will exponentially impact the rate of climate change. We are consistently seeing expected changes occuring 2-3√ó sooner than predicted. 

Whey say we need to meet the Paris agreement goals by 2030, that is a worst case estimate. Instead of planning to reach them in 7 years, we need to be planning to reach them in 2-3. Sounds impossible, right? It is -- *if* we wait for governments and businesses (all of which are tied back to and puppeteered by the fossil fuels industry) to enforce these changes. We cannot trust them to do what is necessary -- they have already sold us out.

It's time for a new plan of action. Each and every one of us must strive to neutraluze our carbon footprint. That means becoming responsible consumers and, most importantly, we must have the integrity to choose sustainability over convenience and luxury... Not some of the time; not most of the time -- **every** time.

It won't be easy or pleasant, but it is **necessary**. This article is right -- people don't want to do this. But if we want to correct our course before we do any further damage, we **MUST** find it in ourselves to do everything -- however great or small -- we can. Nobody is going to make us do it (in fact, if they can capitalize off pushing it off, *they will*) and we're out of time to wait for science to provide new innovations that let us have our cake and eat it, too.

Clearly a vegan riding a bike is a lot better a gasoline powered SUV, but when you start considering that vehicles can be a lot smaller, lighter, and energy-intensive to build (like a smart car, or scooter), that electric vehicle can be powered by renewables, and that people can eat food that are particularly carbon-intensive (like beef), every cyclist doesn't have a smaller carbon footprint than every vehicle. I've never had the time to cook really rigorous research and calculations, but my hunch is that an electric scooter or electric bike (or maybe even something like a golf cart) probably results in less carbon emission than biking.

MCCOOK, Neb. ‚Äî As the sun rose on another hot day, rancher Brad Randel rode through his feed lot working at a grim task ‚Äî culling cattle from his herd because his ranch‚Äôs sparse grass can‚Äôt sustain them during a crushing drought.

As Randel swung his quarter horse Bay Belle in tight circles, he and a ranch hand separated runty Black Angus heifers to be sold at a livestock auction from the more promising stock. The cows bellowed as the temperature began its climb into the high 90s, the remnants of a late-summer heat wave that blasted the American West with furnace-like temperatures.

In other years, Randel would have kept the smaller heifers longer to see if he could fatten them up. ‚ÄúBut this is no typical year,‚Äù he said.

For more than a year, southwest Nebraska has been in the throes of a record drought that has transformed acres of rich pasture and cropland into miles of dirt and ruined corn, soybeans and milo. Wildfires fueled by high temperatures and dry grass swept through more than 140,000 acres this spring, and rivers, ponds and streams have dried up, forcing ranchers to drive miles to bring water to their parched animals.

The shift threatens a way of life for farmers and ranchers, including many who have worked this corner of the prairie since their great-grandparents homesteaded properties in the late 19th century. In a summer where a surprise early heat wave killed more than 2,000 cattle in Kansas that had not yet shed their winter coats, and water scarcity has deprived many animals of critical sustenance, operators are scrambling to adjust.

Randel and other ranchers are going to great lengths to protect their animals, including closely monitoring temperatures in feed lots and supplying cooling mists, and many are embracing longer-term measures like cutting back on tilling and planting cover crops to prevent soil erosion.

The Biden administration has committed more than $22 billion to climate-friendly farming practices in the Inflation Reduction Act and other measures, on top of more than $4 billion in disaster relief. Yet many of these Americans still say they don‚Äôt believe in climate change and view federal attempts to address agriculture‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions ‚Äî some 11 percent of the U.S. total ‚Äî with suspicion.

Even these steps may not be able to compensate for the drought conditions and extreme weather pummeling the region. This summer ranked as America‚Äôs third hottest on record, with Nebraska ‚Äúground zero‚Äù for drought, seeing its third driest June through August period, with an average of 5.8 inches of precipitation.

In 2016, when the Environmental Voter Project operated in just one state (Massachusetts) [only 2% of American voters](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/documents/2016-annual-report.pdf) listed climate change or the environment as their top priority for voting for president. In 2018, when EVP operated in 6 states,  [7% listed climate change and/or the environment as the most important issue facing the nation](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/documents/annual-report-2018.pdf). In 2020, in a record-high turnout year, when EVP operated in 12 states, and Coronavirus and record unemployment dominated the public consciousness, [14% listed climate change and the environment](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/documents/annual-report-2019-2020.pdf) in their top three priorities. In six years of operation, EPV has created [over a million climate/environmental supervoters](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/documents/2021-impact-report.pdf) ‚Äì‚Äì unlikely-to-vote environmentalists who became such reliable voters that EVP graduated them out of the program. (For context, the 2016 Presidential election was decided by [under 80,000 voters in 3 states, and the 2020 Presidential election was decided by 44,000 voters in 3 states](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/02/940689086/narrow-wins-in-these-key-states-powered-biden-to-the-presidency)).

This year, EVP is targeting over 5.8 million Americans in [17 states](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/results) who prioritize climate or the environment but are unlikely to vote. As of this writing, at least 6 [EVP states](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/results) also have [very close senate races this year](https://www.270towin.com/2022-senate-election/). As long as [**volunteers**](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved) keep calling, writing, and canvassing voters, we could really make this election year a climate year!

Our state has delegated authority from the EPA to enforce it's laws and we receive some of our funding from them in the way of grants (which may go away or be severely reduced). If it wasn't for us barely anyone would get inspected since the EPA doesn't have the manpower. Our entire state has only two or three EPA inspectors assigned to it in my field.  Many states have very excellent run delegated programs. 

I'm fine with States enforcing EPA regulations but at the same time we need the EPA to watch over the State programs to ensure they are actually enforcing the regulations.  We also need the EPA for criminal environmental matters as I can only enforce civil penalties. As a matter of fact I uncovered a big case not to long ago that the EPA is persuing criminal charges on that involves multiple states which is another reason why we need the EPA.

The EPA is very much still necessary and from experience many companies will do anything to save a buck especially the ones in financial trouble. I have seen some aweful stuff over the years.

Unless you live in Gaetz's district, do not call him. He does not represent you and even if they are polite, they will disregard your call (some may say they are even obligated to. He represents HIS district). 

What you SHOULD do. 

Go here: http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/

Find out who your rep is. 

Call them and ask them if they have a position on HR 861 yet. Tell them you're against it and would like them to oppose it. 

BE POLITE. The person picking up the phone is likely an un-paid intern who gets yelled at on the phone all day. Imagine being customer service for Congress? It's rough. They're just people. Go easy on them. 

Sample script:

""Hi, I'm ____ and I live in ____'s district. I'm calling to ask that he/she oppose HR 861"". That's it, it's easy, don't be nervous about it, people do it all day every day. 

They may ask for your name and address, feel free to give it to them. That means you should get a follow up letter on the issue, explaining the rep's stance on the bill (and environmental protection in general), and how they plan to vote. 

Be engaged! It's awesome! the system works better when you're involved, but please don't call other reps, your calls are ignored, and you jam up the lines for people who live in the district and may have issues that need addressing. 

Happy to answer any questions.

Source: Used to work on The Hill. 

Edit: Feel free to e-mail your rep or write them a letter, it all does the same thing - it gets put into a CRM system, where a bill like HR 861 will have a for and against count. Larger more complex bills may be broken down into more nuanced positions, and there may be other master thematic lists your call / e-mail / letter get added to, ""ie, ""HR 861 CON"", and ""ENV PRO"" - but ultimately it's just another tick mark, doesn't matter how they hear from you.

That's right. Cars with actually less and cleaner emission are currently not allowed in the USA because it doesn't meet standards of the EPA.

Have they done anything to slow urbanization? 

No, in fact urbanization is being promoted in America's suburbs because having a more expensive home makes you a prick and it isn't fair to people who can't have one. 

Have they done enough to reduce plastic pollution in our ocean, rivers, and lakes? 

Hardly, still selling cokes with plastic rings and still using plastic bags in mass quantities because cutting down trees was bad. 

Have they done enough to reduce deforestation in third world countries? 

Uh no, it's all ""sustainable"" now despite the trees still being felled and having been for nearly a century both domestic and abroad. 

Has their sister organization the FDA put a stopper to antibiotic use? There has been some talk, but so far very little action. 

Has the other sister org, put a stopper to factory farming which is hugely taxing to our environment and waterways that are close to these sites? Hmmmm, also no. 

What they did do is help to create outsourcing and dump all of our bad practices on countries that have virtually zero regulations in some factories. 

Has the FDA reduced pain med abuse and legalized marijuana which would not only reduce ODs, but would also reduce accidental poisonings among children and provide the American people with a natural alternative to harsh medicine? 

What, like only a couple of states can sell it. It's still not a Federal law but you can get all the alcohol you want and destroy your liver. 

I'm having a hard time seeing the EPA, the FDA and the USDA in a positive light. It's almost as if these organizations created problems for us and refuse to resolve them. 

So goodbye EPA. I won't miss your hypocritical bullshit that has pissed me off since I was just a kid.

Coral fragging was a well known method well before this project, often used in the aquaria hobby, often by hobbyists rather than scientists.

What makes this project unique is the manner in which he is creating populations that will be resistant to climate change. IIRC he's been essentially adjusting the coral frags to more acidic and warm water to better prepare them for our changing climate.

While the title is 100% clickbait and false, the true work being done here is unique, original and potentially climate saving.

Not a day goes by that I'm not reminded how grateful I am to have interned with that fabulous organization. I worked under Dr. Kevan Main, who was recognized by President Obama for her work in the field of Aquaculture.

Edit: thanks for the gold! I'm glad others can be inspired and informed by my passion, everyone deserves a job they're passionate about.


Edit 3: thanks for the second gold, I genuinely appreciate the questions and messages even more though. I've been sitting in my stinking work clothes for an hour answering questions out of excitement. I'm gonna shower then I'll check back later, I want more questions people, I've got some really great ones so far, and I think that's awesome.

Edit 2:: Since this blew up I'll share some basic knowledge about the types of aquaculture I've worked in. I've interned with stock enhancement research facilities, a finfish production farm, and now work at a shellfish farm.

Stock enhancement typically entails breeding fish in both intensive (indoors in massive tank) and extensive (outdoor in man-made ponds) methods for the sake of replenishing local populations. Typically broodstock (moms and dads) are either brought back to the farm from an area where the population being replenished reside, or they are stripped of their egg and sperm in the wild, and those are brought to a lab. Either way, the intended goal is sometimes to perform research on the species for the sake of better breeding it, or understanding its population dynamics, other times it's simply to breed them and release the juvenile for replenishment. Steps are taken to ensure that the fish are genetically, and behaviorally similar to the wild population.

Finfish production is just good old farming. There's still a lot of science, but not for environmentalism's sake, just to keep the fish healthy and the farm efficient. Finfish farming is a touchy subject in that many species require an environmentally harmful amount of biomass to grow, and are still chosen for their demand. That being said, there is a push towards more environmentally friendly species choice (tilapia is a great example).

Shellfish farming is a rapidly growing type of aquaculture right now. Oysters and mussels are the big species, but scallop, some clam species, and algae species are making waves too now. Oysters are either grown in cages, or spread across the sea and then dredged. Bottom culture methods are falling out of fashion as they are less environmentally friendly, and typically produce a poorer crop in terms of quality and survival rate. Cage grown oysters are sometimes suspended from a longline that's floated on the surface, or dropped to the bottom. In the west of the U.S. it's not uncommon to set up oyster bags on the tidal flats, they get ~12 hrs of water a day, then spend the rest of the day drying out to fight biofouling, crafty farmers even get the bags to flip themselves using the current, helping to chip the oysters giving them a better cup.

Mussels are grown rather simply, they cling onto specialized rope that is attached to a floated longline and dropped in long loops. The 'seed' mussels cling to the rope and grow, eventually the rope is pulled through a machine, the mussels fall into a massive bag, and are either replanted, or harvest ready.

Shellfish farming has a few unique environmental upsides. The primary one is that shellfish filter water to feed. A single oyster filters 50 gallons of water a day (the farm I work at harvests over 1 million oyster a year), eating phytoplankton they extract from the water. As a side effect the water quality is enhanced by their presence alone. The billion oyster project is an effort to plant oysters in the New York Harbor to better the water quality.

Additionally, the cages and the oysters themselves provide much needed habitat in areas that were once full of oyster bed reefs. Areas on the East coast used to be laden with beds of oyster reefs that were known to take out boats. The combination of enhanced water quality and addition of habitat increases both the biodiversity (# of species) and biomass (# of organisms) around shellfish farms. This is both a studied phenomenon, and one I've seen first hand, it takes just a moment to catch a healthy, legal size fish off our farm, and our cages are always covered in algae, tunicates, and sponges, and full of worms, crabs, starfish and all sorts of critters. 

I'm more than happy to answer any questions, and will try to respond to all questions, especially to those who read through my wall of text about aquaculture, this really is what I am passionate about.

After digging a little deeper Im seeing that they agreed to hear the case in the fall. So it probably hinges on what happens in November. If we have lots of red states democracy ends. If we have a bunch of blue states they wont touch it until the next cycle. Still some hope there I guess. Fingers crossed.

These are oversight roles that deal with general management, site engineering, and environmental impacts.
2) Wyoming has over half of its gas/oil production on federal lands. The state will immediately feel an impact if these stop producing, which will happen if the oversight role is not filled. You can't continue to operate sites if no one is receiving submittal paperwork (DBE, assessments, payrolls).
3) To work on federal land requires a contract, which will include stipulations regarding delays for both sides. If the government risks being sued for delaying operations, then the employees dealing with those delays are essential.

Sorry, but this is an essential role and is not illegal. Despite the corporate hate here, this is just how businesses have to operate with the government, and of course they are given preference over environmental groups, its profits vs expenses.

That wasn‚Äôt what I really got from that. 

There are special situations where sometimes animals including endangered species are subject to be harmed, injured, killed, etc when projects that are simultaneously helping a public service as well.

Example Wind turbines which help offset carbon footprint in the world do sometimes have the outcome of fatalities from birds and such collided with blades. The Indiana bat is one of them. This bat has had a few cases where they were the subject to this cause. That being said the industry still have repercussions from having such outcome and try to ensure it as habitat friendly as possible while in the planing phase as so forth. But you can‚Äôt overcome every situation where this happens. What to do? Get rid of wind turbines?

Same thing with pesticides. Everyone goes to the store and everyone picks their produce according to the aesthetics. If it had pit marks and bruises would you buy it? Probably not. The apples that you buy probably had pesticides and herbicides sprayed on them if they weren‚Äôt organic, so that bugs didn‚Äôt ruin the ‚Äòlook‚Äô of the apple.

And to become organic is one of the hardest things to do in this country right now. Every few months a new rule or regulation is added to their list to follow. It costs thousands if not millions in some cases to switch. 

The farmers and ranchers we have in our country are not all ‚Äúrich‚Äù or ‚Äúlive in mansions‚Äù. They have families and bills like everyone else and break their backs everyday, not just Monday to Friday 8-4. They do this everyday to supply everyone with food in your grocery stores. 

There is always a small chance that animals can have diverse effects from pesticides or any of the operations we have implemented in society. but only because public demands it be on their shelves. 

I‚Äôm sure the government would not have complied with this situation. This article didn‚Äôt even list all ‚Äúthree agencies‚Äù.

Look if you want to pretend like Bill won that's your agenda, but as someone who actually has to teach about controversial issues and a researcher myself, he clearly is not knowledgeable enough or skilled in how to debate to be discussing the issue. If think Bill did a service to environmental science with that interview you likely are engaging in some cognitive dissonance yourself. 

And again, I do not agree with Carlson but let's assume he genuinely just wants an answer to help him decide whether or not climate change is definitively caused by humans.

Now we're trying to limit how fucked we are, and we have 10 years to complete a massive global overhaul of the energy, transportation, and agricultural sectors. We have to do all this with a continually growing global population, and the fact that nobody ever listens to the people that warn us until it's too late. As it is, it's already too late for some parts of the planet.

The human experiment on Earth has failed. Everything takes time, and from what I'm reading(not just here), it would take at least 10 years just to get the energy sector done *if we started right now*. Correct me if I'm wrong. I'd never be more happy to be wrong.

The kind of change we are talking about would need iron fists to achieve, a global force to save what's left of the Earth. With the way politics currently work, and the amount of money being passed around behind closed doors by big money and oil, there is now way.

I'm glad I haven't had kids yet. Barring an accident or an enormous change of heart, I probably never will. I won't subject them to what's coming in the future. I wish more had been done, but I'm only 24. There isn't much of anything I could've done.

Humanity better invest in its space programs. It's not impossible, but someone only has a few years to figure out how to save the planet as we know it and humanity, before we have to start looking at the stupid, impossible options. Fuck.

At least 50 per cent of this was primary unlogged forest. Malaysia and Indonesia produce over 85 per cent of the world‚Äôs palm oil. Borneo produced 16.5 million tonn. And with demand increasing, the decimation is accelerating. 

The Indonesian government has targeted a doubling of palm oil production from 20 million tonnes in 2009 to 40 million tonnes in 2020. 

This increase is mainly driven by further conversion of forest to plantation as Malaysia and Indonesia lag behind in improving yields from existing plantations In Malaysia, oil palm land use has expanded fivefold since the 1980s, while yields have increased by less than 30 per cent in the same time. In Indonesia, all increases in production have been achieved through expansion of lands given over to oil palm. 

The short-term revenues for palm oil are high compared with alternative land use, and this has driven a massive conversion effort. In 2014, the Malaysian and Indonesian governments reduced export duties on palm oil to zero. There are now more than 3.6 million ha of palm oil plantations across Borneo.  Palm oil is used in processed food, snacks, cooking and biofuels. 

The Bornean rainforest is estimated to be between 130 and 140 million years old. As many as 240 different tree species can grow within a single hectare, with another 120 in the hectare adjacent. The canopy is usually 24 to 36 m high, with some trees reaching as high as 65m. The tallest trees are hundreds of years old.  

The forests and peat lands of Borneo are particularly important carbon sinks, storing approximately 230 tonnes of carbon per ha in above ground biomass, and 2,400 tonnes per ha in peat soils.

I'd love to see the report that this is coming from, because I've seen several other studies that show that chicken consumption has increased during that time.

http://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/per-capita-consumption-of-poultry-and-livestock-1965-to-estimated-2012-in-pounds/

And that study also shows that while there has been a net decrease of 3.2% decrease in overall meat consumption, it shows that the largest drop in consumption was also corollary to the highest gas prices, which increased the cost of feed corn (with ethanol prices as well).

In fact, the big story here is that beef prices have essentially doubled in the same time period as the article

http://beef2live.com/story-retail-ground-beef-prices-year-january-0-111644

In 2005 ground beef averaged $2.19, while in 2015 that price had gone up to $4.24.

And as we see beef prices possibly begin to decrease, we will also likely see consumption move closer to previous levels.

TL:DR - This article seems to be wrong about several facts and likely has nothing to do with anything other than costs to consumers driving consumption. As those costs continue to decrease, it's unlikely that meat consumption is going to continue to ""decrease""",6/6/17 18:20,13,/r/environment/comments/6fl9w8/eating_less_beef_americans_dropped_their_carbon/dijj90p/,0

[‚Äì]FireFoxG 30 points 8 days ago 
Can anyone point to a source showing how much this agreement will affect temperatures by the end of the century?

[‚Äì]FireFoxG 33 points 7 days ago 

As I expected. I knew the answer(as best as anyone can), but the proponents of climate change policy will NEVER answer this question because it would expose the ridiculousness of mitigation policy.

The following is as close to proof as we can get about just how much it would cost to slow global warming.

Using the IPCC's own calculations, I will show that the policy recommendations to ""stop"" climate change are insane.


The IPCC figured a 5% cut in emissions when Australia implemented it's carbon tax by 2020. (the largest and most ambitious plan implemented to date) source source2


100% of Australia's emissions are 1.2% of global emissions.


The 5% cut of Australia's global amount of 1.2% is 0.07% of total global emissions.


IPCC figures Co2 will be 410ppm by 2020


0.07% of the 10ppm increase by 2020 is 409.993 ppm


IPCC equation for Co2 forcing is (5.35 * ln(current Co2 / revised Co2 )) or (5.35 * ln(410/409.993)) source


(5.35 * ln(410/409.993))= 0.00009134224 w/m2 of reduced forcing


Climate sensitivity parameter is simple the change in temperature per w/m2 increase. In other words, the actual change in temp divided by the change in energy 'imbalance' since the start of the industrial revolution(150 years). Accounting for El Nino it's risen ~ 0.7-0.8 K over the last 150 years, but lets just say 1 C. 


(5.35 * ln(400 / 280)) = 1.90821095007 w/m2


1 C / 1.90821095007 = 0.52 K per w/m2 (PS, This number is unlikely to rise because it's derived from a natural logarithm, thus will asymptotically approach zero as Co2 concentrations rise)


Then figure the climate sensitivity parameter of 0.52( 0.00009134224) and you get 0.0000474979648 C reduction in global temperatures.

Read that again... it's 1:21,000th of a single degree Celsius.

Now... for the kicker... The IPCC estimated it would cost Australia 160 billion dollars over the 10 year carbon tax plan to get 0.00009134224 w/m2 of reduced forcing.. source, 2011 Garnaut Report, 11.2 billion per year tax, plus other indirect costs

To save a full degree Celsius of warming, based on the IPCC's own math on the Australian carbon tax plan, would cost 3.2 quadrillion dollars.... or 43 times total global GDP.

Does climate change really matter if the only realistic solution is an economic apocalypse?

According the the stern report(the biggest economic study ever done on climate economics, by the Royal Society of the UK), global costs, under a worst case(nothing done) scenario are expected to be ~ 5% of GDP per year. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_Review most studies show less then this, around 1-3% of gdp

That means that if the costs of a carbon tax costs the average person more then 5% per year, then it is not worth it. Given that emissions are basically synonymous with GDP, a 5% cut in emissions would have an impact on temperatures literally too small to measure, but huge economic ramifications.

To use the above math on how long it would take to achieve a single C drop in temps spending 5% of global GDP on it.


(5.35 * ln(400 / (400+ (20 * 0.05)))) = -0.01335830906 w/m2 (co2 rises ~ 2ppm per year, figured a 5% cut over 10 years, or 400 +(20 * 0.05))


(0.52) * -0.01335830906 = -0.00694632071 K


1/0.00694632071 = 143.96 * 10 = 1440 YEARS

Well fuck. 1440 years to mitigate a single degree C at 5% GDP cost(3.5 trillion per year). How many star systems can we colonize before then? 

So you are stuck in a paradox. Either you drastically lower the average living standard to a level far worse then climate change would ever cause, or cut emissions to a level that would have no discernible impact on global temperatures. In either case, it makes no sense.

You can argue about the plants and animals... But I can guarantee that any cut that is forced on people strong enough to have a measurable impact... would cause an economic apocalypse large enough to cause widespread environmental destruction. Starving people will burn the forests for energy and hunt everything to extinction, in order to survive.

To end this... Nuclear power is the only realistically viable path to disconnecting the carbon emission = GDP connection, But It's not ""deniers"" stopping the nuclear revolution... it's environmentalists.

You may want to look at the above and realize most of what you have been spoon feed is BS.",6/6/17 14:35,-21,/r/environment/comments/6fl9w8/eating_less_beef_americans_dropped_their_carbon/dij6lil/,0

Here is a company making a small change that will reduce greenhouse gas.

It also supports ocean farming which has a huge potential to reduce greenhouse gas.

It's sad that this post is filled with negative comments about progress. Yes, I know there are a lot of people in this sub that believe it's vegan or nothing, but in reality most people are not going to go vegan. If methane from cows are dramatically reduced, ocean farms get more money and they grow more shellfish that help with the excess nitrogen in the water and feed humans in a much more environmentally friendly way, that's a good thing, right?

This is the equivalent of saying that electric cars are a waste of time because they still require mining and manufacturing, and we should only be walking and biking as transportation. That's not a reality.

Edit - As predicted this went over the head of the vegans who commented and they came out full force. ""Vegan is the only way"" has been repeated over and over more or less.

However, I have a significant amount of upvotes and I know the vegans were downvoting. This tells me that the majority of people on this sub do care about environmental progress and are not fixated on the impossible task of making everyone in the world a vegan. They also don't care to comment because they know vegans will come after them if their post doesn't support ""everyone needs to go vegan"".

I wonder how many people would be interested in an environment/sustainable sub where loud vegans got banned so sustainable ideas could be discussed without having to argue with a vegan.

And only one thing is getting in the way of our salvation is greed. The richest people on the planet have enormous influence on policy makers, and they have repeatedly backed their own selfish gain rather than the good of humanity. A recent study(1) has shown that 100 companies cause 71% of the global green house gas emissions. Those companies need to cover the cost of the destruction they are causing, and world governments need to enforce that punishment. If you want to know what you can do to help reduce the human impact, switching to a plant based diet can reduce your personal green house gas emissions by 50%!(2) This may seem like a drastic step, but we all have to make sacrifices for the greater good. There are also plenty of environmental charities that you can donate to that can make your dollar go much farther than you can. (3) Lets take action, for the sake of our futures, and our childrens' futures, and all future generations. And remember, the Earth will be fine, the environment will regenerate after we are all gone. The Earth isn't what needs saving, its us who need saving.

Miners are users of last resort, meaning that they sign long term energy contracts requiring energy producers to increase capacity, and then during outages or periods of high demand they shutdown and give their supply back to the grid, thus avoiding blackouts. Energy producers can‚Äôt increase supply during a blackout. 

You could force miners to pay for renewable capacity and have them be users of last resort, like they are now. Creating a greater pool of renewables and creating a greater pool to draw from in blackouts. 

But that isn‚Äôt what this is about. It‚Äôs about attacking a product  that they think undermines reserve currency status. And they will drive it offshore. They won‚Äôt kill it, but they will lose control of it and it should be another tool on the balance sheet in the rapidly advancing multi currency world. 

When compared to the existing financial system the energy use is minute. It is border-less, it is global, it is permission-less, which is the saving grace when your currency is debased, your country is invaded, or your monetary system keeps you unbanked.",5/2/23 17:54,0,/r/environment/comments/135luoh/biden_proposes_30_climate_change_tax_on/jilad7n/,0

As angry as I am that our national conversation was hijacked by a small industry, it doesn't make me unsympathetic to their very real problems.

But the reality is that they aren't easily solved problems.  Anyone who says they can 'fix it' by returning to the glory days is lying.  There is simply no way to do that.  It's impossible.

Even if coal output increases, the industry is heavily automated and jobs will never bounce back no matter how much we try to prop up burning coal.  There's no way to bring those jobs back.

I don't pretend to have an answer, but if other industries are an example, there's no easy way out.  Carriage makers, whalers, cowboys, and a large number of once-thriving American industries are gone forever.  The reality is that the workers need to adapt to a new world order.  They either need to move and chase better jobs, or work to develop new industries in their area.

Appalachia is one of the most beautiful areas of the country.  People will happily move there if they have economic opportunity.

Hi I‚Äôm an average guy who woke up an activist on November 9th and found this march:

 Tell EVERYBODY. Game on, April 29, 2017.

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). 

Lets tell our representatives we want to **stay in the Paris Agreement!** If they don't, they'll see we're organized and will vote them out!

10 million strong, seriously. Aim high. ACT LIKE CHAMPIONS! LET'S DO THIS! And then at least feel like we've tried and done something historic, ya know? 
________

**Edit:**

To address concerns in the comments: **pledge to lower your CO2 spent to get to the march.** This sends a good signal, such as: train = if you can take a train. car = carpool. bus = rally bus. airplane = carbon offset (plant 25 trees per person). **Other ideas?** Especially for those who'd have to fly?

Let‚Äôs take an extreme scenario where a many people fly all the way across the country. That would cost at most in hundreds of thousands of metric tons of CO2 emissions. [carbon calculator](http://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3) 

Staying in the Paris Agreement **reduces carbon emissions by BILLIONS of metric tons and puts us on a sustainable course for good.**

The top grey dotted line in [this info graphic](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/US-emissions-chart.jpg) is if the Paris Agreement with American participation doesn‚Äôt happen. Game over.

_________

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/) are the same folks that organized the biggest climate march to date in 2014 with hundreds of thousands. Now they‚Äôre at it again, on April 29th 2017 right before Trump's 100 days.

Are there other groups that combine environmental organizations that you know of? If so, who? Get them to join this march! 

Are there other marches scheduled that others don't know of yet? How can we combine them into one massive showing?

I think his election is scaring many of us (myself being an example) into activism mode, rather than assuming our gov is taking care of the problem (like the Paris global initiative Obama put together that Trump threatens to dismantle).

INVITE EVERYONE WHO ALREADY CARES

Peoplesclimate.org is a combo of dozens of organizations, including 350.org, as seen at bottom of page. Let's help them add even more to the list. 

**Invite Bernie** and his millions on board, all democrats and more Environmental Organizations.

Invite DiCaprio who made the powerful documentary Before the Flood, and has millions of twitter followers. 

And other passionate media folks and celebrities who can reach the masses. If you happen to know any, invite them!

And the Clintons, and Gore. If this is really about the preservation of our planet, it's wake up time.

Reach out to younger people in their 20s and even High School, who will inherit this planet. 

Reach to all environmental organizations and get them to join this march, like The Sierra Club and ‚Ä¶ ?

How about religious organizations? Even the POPE spoke out recently!!! This involves ALL OF US. This is something we can all agree and come together on!

__________
REACHING OUT TO MODERATE CONSERVATIVES

I've actually seen on reddit that moderate conservatives, many who voted Trump, still believe in climate change. I think we should make it a CENTRIST issue. Take out the political charge, and base it in stewards of our earth and country. Reach across the divide, why not? Have some real conversations based in fact. Know the economic concerns of those who push back against regulation and acknowledge them, and support them in adapting.

Recent reddit comments brought up the fact that if sea level rise doesn't scare em into action, which may not matter as much to those inland as it does on the coast, then reframe it to the impact of stronger storms and tornados, and droughts on crop production. And overall the impact on our economy if the coastal cities and towns are under water.

We need republican support in congress to move the needle. and if not, then they need to be afraid of getting reelected.

This fella is trying, for example: [Jay Faison's Quest to Save the Planet (And the GOP)](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-01/jay-faison-s-expensive-maddening-quest-to-save-the-planet-and-the-gop)

______________
MASSIVE MOVEMENT BRINGS EDUCATION AND ACTION

10 million people marching. I'm not even kidding. 20 million Muslims just marched in Iraq against ISIS. 2 million marched in South Korea against their president. If they all can organize in face of a dire threat, so can we.

In addition to marching, just organizing into a mass movement can spread actionable ideas. Educating people on the low hanging fruit, the easier first steps towards reducing emissions in our day to day choices. 

If millions organize and speak with our votes and dollars ... support green initiatives and companies, then we fight through governmental and capitalist methods. 

The carbon tax for example is the biggest government move. We need to educate ourselves on a deeper level on the real issue(s), like the pros/cons of the carbon tax. I understand it could hurt business profit, which is the reason for so much push back. And that we're taking on more of the burden as part of the Paris Accord then the rest of the world, is another push back I've read. We need intelligent answers to these issues. 

And Climate Denial? The Pentagon and NASA have published proof of our impact on Climate Change. We need to counter the vocal deniers.  But we already have the numbers for massive action. There‚Äôs a reason why Obama was able to align 197 countries in the Paris Agreement.

We fixed the ozone layer, we've increased fuel efficiency, and safety. We can do this heavy lift, even if it imposes on profit, if it's necessary to support life on freaking earth!

Are there other groups that combine environmental organizations that you know of? If so, who? Get them to join this march! 

Are there other marches scheduled that others don't know of yet? How can we combine them into one massive showing?

I think his election is scaring many of us (myself being an example) into activism mode, rather than assuming our gov is taking care of the problem (like the Paris global initiative Obama put together that Trump threatens to dismantle).

INVITE EVERYONE WHO ALREADY CARES

Peoplesclimate.org is a combo of dozens of organizations, including 350.org, as seen at bottom of page. Let's help them add even more to the list. 

**Invite Bernie** and his millions on board, all democrats and more Environmental Organizations.

Invite DiCaprio who made the powerful documentary Before the Flood, and has millions of twitter followers. 

And other passionate media folks and celebrities who can reach the masses. If you happen to know any, invite them!

And the Clintons, and Gore. If this is really about the preservation of our planet, it's wake up time.

Reach out to younger people in their 20s and even High School, who will inherit this planet. 

Reach to all environmental organizations and get them to join this march, like The Sierra Club and ‚Ä¶ ?

How about religious organizations? Even the POPE spoke out recently!!! This involves ALL OF US. This is something we can all agree and come together on!

REACHING OUT TO MODERATE CONSERVATIVES

I've actually seen on reddit that moderate conservatives, many who voted Trump, still believe in climate change. I think we should make it a CENTRIST issue. Take out the political charge, and base it in stewards of our earth and country. Reach across the divide, why not? Have some real conversations based in fact. Know the economic concerns of those who push back against regulation and acknowledge them, and support them in adapting.

Recent reddit comments brought up the fact that if sea level rise doesn't scare em into action, which may not matter as much to those inland as it does on the coast, then reframe it to the impact of stronger storms and tornados, and droughts on crop production. And overall the impact on our economy if the coastal cities and towns are under water.

We need republican support in congress to move the needle. and if not, then they need to be afraid of getting reelected.

This fella is trying, for example: [Jay Faison's Quest to Save the Planet (And the GOP)](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-01/jay-faison-s-expensive-maddening-quest-to-save-the-planet-and-the-gop)

MASSIVE MOVEMENT BRINGS EDUCATION AND ACTION

10 million people marching. I'm not even kidding. 20 million Muslims just marched in Iraq against ISIS. 2 million marched in South Korea against their president. If they all can organize in face of a dire threat, so can we.

In addition to marching, just organizing into a mass movement can spread actionable ideas. Educating people on the low hanging fruit, the easier first steps towards reducing emissions in our day to day choices. 

If millions organize and speak with our votes and dollars ... support green initiatives and companies, then we fight through governmental and capitalist methods. 

The carbon tax for example is the biggest government move. We need to educate ourselves on a deeper level on the real issue(s), like the pros/cons of the carbon tax. I understand it could hurt business profit, which is the reason for so much push back. And that we're taking on more of the burden as part of the Paris Accord then the rest of the world, is another push back I've read. We need intelligent answers to these issues. 

And Climate Denial? The Pentagon and NASA have published proof of our impact on Climate Change. We need to counter the vocal deniers.  But we already have the numbers for massive action. There‚Äôs a reason why Obama was able to align 197 countries in the Paris Agreement.

We fixed the ozone layer, we've increased fuel efficiency, and safety. We can do this heavy lift, even if it imposes on profit, if it's necessary to support life on freaking earth!

 Tell EVERYBODY. Game on, April 29, 2017.

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). 

Lets tell our representatives we want to **stay in the Paris Agreement!** If they don't, they'll see we're organized and will vote them out!

10 million strong, seriously. Aim high. ACT LIKE CHAMPIONS! LET'S DO THIS! And then at least feel like we've tried and done something historic, ya know?

**Edit:**

To address concerns in the comments: **pledge to lower your CO2 spent to get to the march.** This sends a good signal, such as: train = if you can take a train. car = carpool. bus = rally bus. airplane = carbon offset (plant 25 trees per person). **Other ideas?** Especially for those who'd have to fly?

Let‚Äôs take an extreme scenario where a many people fly all the way across the country. That would cost at most in hundreds of thousands of metric tons of CO2 emissions. [carbon calculator](http://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3) 

Staying in the Paris Agreement **reduces carbon emissions by BILLIONS of metric tons and puts us on a sustainable course for good.**

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/) are the same folks that organized the biggest climate march to date in 2014 with hundreds of thousands. Now they‚Äôre at it again, on April 29th 2017 right before Trump's 100 days.

Are there other groups that combine environmental organizations that you know of? If so, who? Get them to join this march! 

Are there other marches scheduled that others don't know of yet? How can we combine them into one massive showing?

I think his election is scaring many of us (myself being an example) into activism mode, rather than assuming our gov is taking care of the problem (like the Paris global initiative Obama put together that Trump threatens to dismantle).

INVITE EVERYONE WHO ALREADY CARES

Peoplesclimate.org is a combo of dozens of organizations, including 350.org, as seen at bottom of page. Let's help them add even more to the list. 

**Invite Bernie** and his millions on board, all democrats and more Environmental Organizations.

Invite DiCaprio who made the powerful documentary Before the Flood, and has millions of twitter followers. 

And other passionate media folks and celebrities who can reach the masses. If you happen to know any, invite them!

And the Clintons, and Gore. If this is really about the preservation of our planet, it's wake up time.

Reach out to younger people in their 20s and even High School, who will inherit this planet. 

Reach to all environmental organizations and get them to join this march, like The Sierra Club and ‚Ä¶ ?

How about religious organizations? Even the POPE spoke out recently!!! This involves ALL OF US. This is something we can all agree and come together on!

REACHING OUT TO MODERATE CONSERVATIVES

I've actually seen on reddit that moderate conservatives, many who voted Trump, still believe in climate change. I think we should make it a CENTRIST issue. Take out the political charge, and base it in stewards of our earth and country. Reach across the divide, why not? Have some real conversations based in fact. Know the economic concerns of those who push back against regulation and acknowledge them, and support them in adapting.

Recent reddit comments brought up the fact that if sea level rise doesn't scare em into action, which may not matter as much to those inland as it does on the coast, then reframe it to the impact of stronger storms and tornados, and droughts on crop production. And overall the impact on our economy if the coastal cities and towns are under water.

We need republican support in congress to move the needle. and if not, then they need to be afraid of getting reelected.

This fella is trying, for example: [Jay Faison's Quest to Save the Planet (And the GOP)](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-01/jay-faison-s-expensive-maddening-quest-to-save-the-planet-and-the-gop)

MASSIVE MOVEMENT BRINGS EDUCATION AND ACTION

10 million people marching. I'm not even kidding. 20 million Muslims just marched in Iraq against ISIS. 2 million marched in South Korea against their president. If they all can organize in face of a dire threat, so can we.

In addition to marching, just organizing into a mass movement can spread actionable ideas. Educating people on the low hanging fruit, the easier first steps towards reducing emissions in our day to day choices. 

If millions organize and speak with our votes and dollars ... support green initiatives and companies, then we fight through governmental and capitalist methods. 

The carbon tax for example is the biggest government move. We need to educate ourselves on a deeper level on the real issue(s), like the pros/cons of the carbon tax. I understand it could hurt business profit, which is the reason for so much push back. And that we're taking on more of the burden as part of the Paris Accord then the rest of the world, is another push back I've read. We need intelligent answers to these issues. 

And Climate Denial? The Pentagon and NASA have published proof of our impact on Climate Change. We need to counter the vocal deniers.  But we already have the numbers for massive action. There‚Äôs a reason why Obama was able to align 197 countries in the Paris Agreement.

We fixed the ozone layer, we've increased fuel efficiency, and safety. We can do this heavy lift, even if it imposes on profit, if it's necessary to support life on freaking earth!

The trouble with trying to appeal to these people on environment issues is that they have higher priorities that currently eclipse environmental concerns, and so many environmental efforts have the side effect of hurting these people economically.


To build a bridge, environmental concerns have to have real impact to these people with their jobs and how much money they have. If those concerned with the environment continue to have an elitist mentality that they should be dictating to these people, there will be no way to convince Trump.

The typical story we tell is that science involves isolating something & then manipulating it, making predictions & disconfirming or falsifying null hypotheses.  Now, this idealization is basically a myth across the board, but it is a useful fiction to describe *lab* science.

Astronomy, however, is more like a *field* science, having more in common with geology than biochemistry or particle physics. While obviously all sub disciplines intermingle & use each other's results, field sciences do not have the luxury of manipulation & isolation. Ceteris paribus clauses are basically impossible & variables can't be made to vary independently. That said, predictions are still possible for some.

So, astronomers can make predictions which may or may not come true and while issues like the 3 Body problem quickly become intractable, we are lucky to have great apparatuses & shortcuts to predictive validity on a precise scale. Thus even without independence or manipulation, we can still falsify etc.


But then, there are descriptive sciences, ones having to do with the past, like some geology or archaeology etc. In these conditions, there's no experimentation or prediction, per se, though there can be disconfirmation of sorts (rather than an induction being contradicted, it's a deduction from theory).

But then you get even farther out, with things like ecology & so on, which do make micro predictions & deductions, but in general are observational. For a lot of issues in evolution or ecology we cannot see the past, per se, we can't manipulate the present & predictions have to be statistical over an aggregated population. We're far from the lab now!

Finally, you get to climate science, epidemiology & the like. While some aspects of it are predictive (short term meteorology) especially the sub disciplines that comprise it, predicting climate change & smoking deaths are more akin to ecology--they are associational & aggregate. And while we can understand micro mechanisms such as carcinogens & weather patterns, dynamic systems are definitionally emergent--this means the only way to see the outcome is to run the model itself, so to speak, rather than predict an outcome of the model & disconfirm it.

Now, NONE of this invalidates these sciences. Smoking causes cancer and humans are vastly changing the climate faster than it can accommodate, but we don't predict eclipses & storms in the same way.

Because people are only taught the reduced lab science myth, when sciences don't look like that, they think it disproves them--hence disbelief of psychiatry & anthropology & climate science & evolution (though interestingly people do trust economics, I suspect because of its mathiness & physics envy).  This isn't because these ways of studying are unscientific but because the version of science taught to the public is false! People like Damon, NDT & Bill Nye ironically reinforce this, because they glorify an idealized science and then demean those who don't belief in its deviations!

People like to mock STS & the sociology, anthropology, economics & philosophy of science because they see it as post modern voodoo--""there is no social constructionist @ 10,000 feet"" Dawkins says--but this couldn't be further from the truth!

In its quest to typologize & study knowledge as it is made in the real world & historically, it didn't seek to demean science, but expand it & assist it! Indeed, STS scholars are some of the most savage critics of climate denialists. The originator of the 97% of scientists meme? An STS scholar and author of Merchants of Doubt--and she's a social constructionist (a boogeyman among the positivists).

Bruno Latour, often lambasted, is a brilliant critic of climate denialists & conspiracy theorists. Sheila Jasanoff, by showing science & politics interrelation, helps prevent the misuse of one by the other. Steven Shapin has provided us with some of the best understandings of corporate & public science as well as understand declines in public trust of science.

The reason I go on this rant is that I'm sick of the Pinker/Dawkins/Harris/DeGrasse Tyson/Nye monopoly on public science. Their idealization are out dated and are inconsistent with--ironically enough--scientific studies of science! This idealization & arrogance--where science should be about complexity & humility--ends up unwittingly reinforcing the very dynamics they despise.

I'll give you a few examples:

Worried about the threat of creationism, biologists resisted all non darwinian mechanisms for years. Eventually though, the issues of complexity, emergence, epigenetics, preadaptation, cooption, exaptation, evolvability & so on became too numerous. The critic could seize on these despite them not disproving evolution, only making it more complex.

The emphasis on wonkish nerdy highly mathematical science over invested trust in people like financial engineers, the tech industry, Evidence based policy, evidence based medicine & so on. Yet we had a financial crisis, tech isn't creating jobs it's just dominating our attention, evidence based policy was used to eviscerate the public sphere & evidence based medicine is in retrenchment as more humanistic approaches are in vogue again. Had there been less arrogance ahead of time, these would have better reputations (though they differ from the above because these are ""practical"" disciplines).

The insistence on a final theory of everything in physics, instead of perhaps that quantum & relativity may not be resolvable within the scope of human reason generates skepticism, especially when elegant but wacky & untestable theories like string theory fill the gap. 

The insistence that science is about prediction, falsification, labs, skepticism & anti dogmatism made climate science, smoking research, acid rain, environmental issues, criticisms of nuclear issues & criticism of the military's misuse of science all extremely open to the merchants of doubt as Orestes called them.

All the while, the insistence on science's ethical code & objectivity makes it ever more damaging when compromising things--nuclear bombs, Operation Paperclip, Henrietta Lacks, Tuskegee Syphillis, Mengele & the Nazis, Human experimentation generally, military science, bio weapons, for sale scientific opinions, corporate malfeasance in biotech & the everyday perfidy of doctors & wonks--occur. If your avowed public standard is perfection & knowledge, then any deviation is damaging.



*None* of these would be so damaging to sciences & their credibility if the public vision was one of humility, skepticism, error, admission of construction, diversity of technique, non unified epistemology, the validity of several knowledges & the willingness to admit that scientists participate in horrendous corporate & political actions. 


While they all avow skepticism & humility publicly, to act as a cudgel and demean people, to constantly harp on the inadequacies of movies, to say it's objectively true regardless of belief (while also claiming skepticism), to deny social & economic influence & to assert the plainly false claim that the methods that produced them are the same is a recipe for disaster.

When climate change is presented as a health & security issue & market solutions are proposed people (especially conservatives) believe it more. Now i've my own issues with militarizing climate change & market solutions but this should be a clear implication--doubt about climate change is cultural (damn these liberal elites talking down to me!), political (it threatens markets & state sovereignty currently conceived) and personal/psychological (it doesn't affect me or I can't see it). 

Eclipses are visible & though people talk down about viewing them, this is less common. Hurricanes are visible, concrete, personal & ideologically non threatening.

NdGT would be well advised to read the vast literature on the rhetorical, public opinion, education, cognitive, social, historical, economic, political & philosophical studies of science. He should emphasize diversity of methods, the human & social nature of knowledge, the separation of 'truth' from 'practical usefulness' & the validity of ways of living & believing.



Tldr: The way NdGT discusses science & criticizes disbelief reinforces the very simplistic notions & personal & political offense which gives rise to denialism in the first place.",9/1/17 3:01,45,/r/environment/comments/6x6hs1/neil_degrasse_tyson_slams_climate_deniers_for/dmeqc35/,0

First, on the balloons. It‚Äôs dishonest to conflate the use of balloons in an interior space with those found outdoors that ‚Äúwreak havoc on our environment‚Äù These are disposed of in the trash and find their way into a landfill. The argument against them parallels arguments against single use plastics not balloon releases.

Second, convention confetti is tissue paper. It readily breaks down and can be disposed of pretty easily because it breaks down in landfills. It too isn‚Äôt getting out into the environment. And even if it did it would be inconsequential. Maybe there‚Äôs a recycled paper pulp version? Maybe they already use one. The fact is the authors of this article wouldn‚Äôt know because this was a pretty low effort post.

In short, honesty is the best policy.

You could see their faces go from ""having a great time"" to ""what the hell am I watching/doing"" buzzkill to say the least.

~~1: New Orleans has no recycling service at all.  Curbside trash pickup has only garbage collection; no recycling.  This is in a city where drinking alcoholic beverages is pretty much the official pass-time.  Maybe someone will chime in and say that they separate the recycling out of the garbage afterwards but I seriously doubt it.~~

Edit: Apparently curbside recycling was reinstated in 2011, which is weird because I‚Äôve literally never seen a curbside recycling bin. I don‚Äôt live in New Orleans, and only visit seasonally to see friends, who all live generally in the 7th/8th/9th ward areas.  Apparently curbside recycling hasn‚Äôt caught on in those areas.

2: The 2017 rainy season saw abnormal levels of flooding, which prompted the $7 million emergency cleanup that found the gigantic bead clogs.  An additional $22 million contract was pulled because the company involved was found to be improperly dumping it‚Äôs waste.

Maybe the fact that the beads and trash are actually causing an emergency situation could help sway things.  But remember; New Orleans has a reputation as being one of the most politically corrupt cities in the world.

The parades that produce all of those beads and throws are all of the big money, elitist social clubs that roll through the rich Uptown neighborhoods.  Rich people pay thousands of dollars to dress up like pseudo-klansmen and throw useless garbage off of exclusive floats for drunk tourists to fight over.  Nobody actually wants, or keeps, any of the throws.  They just fight over them for the sake of fighting over them, and then throw them away later.  The only throws most people actually collect and reuse is the cups, and some people collect the coins as well.  The only redeeming quality of the big money parades, IMO, is the local high-school marching bands that march with them.  I‚Äôd be willing to bet that a rather large percentage of people at those parades are just there to see the marching bands, and dont GAF about the social clubs and their plastic crap.

Over on the ‚Äúartsy‚Äù side of town, (Marigny/Bywater) many ‚ÄúDIY‚Äù style parades have sprung up, like St. Anne‚Äôs parade and Chewbacchus to name a few, which focus on audience participation and costuming.  Chewbacchus does ‚Äòthrows,‚Äô but they‚Äôre all things that the participants hand-made themselves, and so they are much more rare and coveted. A handful of unofficial, un-permitted renegade art/costume parades have also popped up, which I won‚Äôt mention here because they‚Äôre seeecret :)  But anyone who has participated in any of these parades will tell you how much more awesome, and magical, and real they are than any of the sanctioned parades.  Maybe this trend will catch on, and Mardi Gras will return to being something people *participate* in rather than just spectating.",3/4/19 16:17,13,/r/environment/comments/ax6fnw/its_time_to_rethink_mardi_gras_without_tons_of/ehrvmpd/,0

At all.

First, I‚Äôd gladly pay the 1%. I‚Äôd pay more. This in mind:

A global GDP of 80T doesnt in any conceivable sense mean these are *sales* - or taxable transactions. Enormous portions of that are government debt, inter and intracompany debt, tax payments, government salaries, charitable contributions... Another enormous portion is in things like medical services, infrastructure spending, research - things it doesn‚Äôt make sense to tax in this way. Yet more is wage and income to people that live on a few dollars a day or less. So let‚Äôs be honest and cut that number by 90%. Now we are talking about a 10% tax to get to $800B a year - which is still about 1/5 of what the IPCC report recommends - which is 54T over 12 years. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.amp.html

I do like the way this is thinking- there should be a society-wide, enormous effort to contribute a portion of basically everything to this cause.

First off, Trump has nothing to do with this land rule.  The title is purposely misleading.  It then immediately refers to it as the ""Trump Administration"" in the article, but purposely left out ""administration"" in the headline, making it seem like Trump was somehow solely responsible.

&#x200B;

> Jesse Prentice-Dunn, policy director for the Center for Western  Priorities, called the rule change ‚Äúamazingly cruel‚Äù and said it was  ‚Äújust the latest in a string of efforts to reduce protections for  America‚Äôs wildlife at the behest of oil companies and trophy hunters‚Äù. 

Got it.  His opinion is noted, but if we dig into his position we can clearly see he works for a serious environment group and predominately writes about trump, oil/gas, and the environment.  

[https://muckrack.com/jesse-prentice-dunn/articles](https://muckrack.com/jesse-prentice-dunn/articles)

&#x200B;

> The park service‚Äôs deputy director, David Vela, said the change would  ‚Äúmore closely align hunting and trapping regulations with those  established by the state of Alaska‚Äù. 

So it's not entirely new to the State, if anything it's resembling more of what's currently in place. 

&#x200B;

> A tribal consortium, the Tanana Chiefs Conference, said the Obama rule  was implemented without adequate tribal consultation, in disregard to  rural Alaska‚Äôs dependence on wild food resources, threatening  ‚Äúcenturies-long sustainable management practices‚Äù. 

So right here is something quite interesting to me.   The Tanana Chiefs Conference ( Tanana Chiefs Conference, the traditional tribal consortium of the  42 villages of Interior Alaska, is based on a belief in tribal  self-determination and the need for regional Native unity.) opposed to rule because it actually impacts THEM and their wild food resources.  If anyone should have a say it's the people who have and will continue to live there.

&#x200B;

> Peter Christian, a spokesman with the park service in Alaska, told the [Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2020/05/21/trump-administration-moves-to-ease-rules-for-hunting-bears-and-wolves-on-federal-lands-in-alaska/)  that the changes will allow hunters to draw black bears, including cubs  and females with cubs, out of their dens with artificial light; to use  bait to attract black and brown bears; to hunt wolves and coyotes during  the denning season and to shoot caribou while they are swimming or from  motorboats. 

Interesting.  Let's dig a little bit into what exactly Peter Christian told the Anchorage Daily news in the link they provided.  

&#x200B;

Oh wow.  So the Guardian article you are all reading here, seems to be COMPLETELY different on what they were referencing in the Anchorage Daily News article.

  

>Victor  Joseph, chair of the Tanana Chiefs Conference, said the group  representing 42 tribes in the Interior supports the rollback. The 2015  rule was implemented without ‚Äúadequate tribal consultation,"" he said in a  statement sent by the park service.  
>  
>  
>  
> **‚ÄúThe previous limitations enacted in 2015 threatened our way of life  and our centuries-long sustainable management practices,"" he said in the  statement.**

&#x200B;

Left a part out there didn't they?

&#x200B;

> A 2018 federal environmental assessment of the rollback in the preserves [said that the subsistence harvest of moose and caribou could increase](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/05/22/2018-10735/alaska-hunting-and-trapping-in-national-preserves). 

Interesting.

&#x200B;

  

>Rod  Arno, executive director of the Alaska Outdoor Council, said the park  service‚Äôs final rule is consistent with the Alaska Statehood Act and  honors past agreements between Congress and Alaska.

This report only focuses on Carbon emissions.  People regularly don't think about how much has to be released for all their Consumerist goods, activities & entertainment .  There is a lot of destruction and energy that goes into providing all the infrastructure, transport, storing, advertising, etc for all of those things.

Yes, getting on an all ""Green"" power grid would be a very good step, but even with that we would not be out of danger.  There are other factors that would still lead us over a cliff.

I'm an environmental consultant for EPA region 5 (hydrogeologist).  Relaxing EPA regs is a not a horrible thing in every case. All states (with exception of AK) have cleanup criteria and screening levels more conservative and protective than EPA MCLs. Example: EPA MCL for lead in drinking water is 15 ug/l. MI part 211/213 drinking water criteria is 5 ug/L. This is the case 99 percent of the time.  The vast majority of sites and contaminated facilities are regulated under their respective state with no EPA involvement at all.  Many  state and federal operating regulations are over bearing and overlap. The EPA is mostly lawyers and politicians, that's why they hire consultants.  EPA should be downsized and only handle interstate issues, like if Ohio wants to transport and dispose of waste in Michigan. 

Superfund, RCRA, and brownfield sites were sort of grandfathered in, they were around before states had robust enough agencies. Even so, most superfund sites do not use EPA MCLs.   I do not like Pruitt. He's obviously corrupt. 

It would be nice if Pruitt was replaced by an actual scientist... You know, somebody who can make objective and reasonable decisions to protect the environment and ecology. Most of my clients are lawyers and data quality analysts, not scientists.  I know this post won't go over well here, but maybe a few people would like an opinion from the horse's mouth. I've been consulting for EPA for 10 years now.

His point is that we must stem/cut off the plastic producing and dumping of plastics into the ocean first, something like right now at this momentn there is 50 million tons of plastic produced per (forgot) destined to be in the ocean next week. 

It would be like sewage pouring into your swimming pool, and not fixing the sewage coming in first, but trying to clean the water before addressing the main problem.

Some of his solutions were to incentivize the countries that have poor third workd type economies where daily survival supercedes any type of garbage collection, or recycling. Turns out many of the biggest contributors are these many poor countries that need better or start even, garbage collection and organization. He says the World should give back by giving pay to thses countries to have individuals bring in plastic at a center  and get paid per pound for it.

In every stage of its manufacturing it just does not make any sense. Problem we have now is that we so used to mass production of plastic it‚Äôs seems to be a part of everything. I would love to say just stop using it and then figure a way to deal with the waste plastic we already have. Yet it is not a problem that a solution will be found in my life time. Sad truths.I recently seen  a comedian say that best thing we could do is just stop having kids and enjoy the time we have left.
